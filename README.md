# dictionary_flutter

This is the MASTER repo for The Dictionary, written in flutter.  You may notice that it doesn't do anything.  This is because it only has the core widgets and the DictionaryRDSS code.  Anything like performing lookups and mananging state transistions is left as an exercise for the reader, on a Different Branch!
