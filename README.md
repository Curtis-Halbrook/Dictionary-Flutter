# dictionary_flutter

This is the mvu_layer branch for The Dictionary, written in flutter.  This uses the [MVU](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) pattern in a very "Elm" style.  Like many other patterns, it uses unidirectional flow with messages that alter state via a pure function "reducer".

Current Branches:
Provider_with_MVVM
BLoC_with_flutter_bloc
mvu_layer
